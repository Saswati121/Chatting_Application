This project involves the development of a two-user chat application using Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit), Java Swing, and Socket Programming. 
The application enables real-time communication between two users over a network, providing a simple and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) built with Java Swing components.
The chat interface allows sending and receiving messages, providing a robust foundation for a basic peer-to-peer chat system.
The use of Java AWT enhances the application with basic window features.
Socket programming is implemented to establish a reliable connection between the two clients, enabling seamless message exchange.
